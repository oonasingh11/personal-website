        <h1>Machine Money: Cloudflare's NET Dollar</h1>
        <p class="dek">Cloudflare is reviving HTTP 402 and minting NET Dollar to give autonomous agents a way to pay each other without humans.</p>
        <div class="newsletter-body">
          <p>Hello all. Welcome and welcome back.</p>
          <p>This is a bonus edition because I have not finished writing my ledger and bank issue yet, so enjoy.</p>
          <p>On September 25, 2025, Cloudflare announced NET Dollar. Cloudflare describes it as a fully USD collateralized stablecoin, designed for agentic payments and transactions between AI systems without human involvement. In plain speak: money for robots.</p>
          <p>AI's impact on everything from newsrooms to TikTok has been dissected to death, but the payments angle has not received enough attention. As AI systems begin to act on their own (buying data, querying APIs, paying other agents), the rails they need are not the ones we humans use. Cloudflare is offering one answer to the question: what rails do autonomous agents use when we set them loose on the internet?</p>

          <h2>Cloudflare</h2>
          <p>Cloudflare has long been an integral part of the internet's infrastructure. It accelerates sites, protects against attacks, caches content, and quietly keeps a lot of the web running. If the internet were a city, Cloudflare would be a big chunk of the roads, power lines, and streetlights. It is fitting that Cloudflare, of all companies, is trying to make money from the web itself.</p>
          <p>Cloudflare does not exist in a vacuum. The last couple of years have been a parade of corporate stablecoins. Those are attractive capital products, and you will continue to see more of them aimed at captive user bases for retention, float economics, and ecosystem control. Yet Cloudflare's move feels different. Rather than competing directly in consumer payments, they are carving out a niche: payments between machines.</p>
          <p>They are also calling out a marked shift in how the internet is monetized. For decades, online business models ran on ads and attention, an inheritance from the days of the Ad Man. Cloudflare's pitch: monetize usage itself via tiny, native, programmatic payments.</p>

          <h2>The Ghost of Internet Past (HTTP 402: Payment Required)</h2>
          <p>Before we dive into the 402 protocol itself, a refresher: HTTP is the application protocol of the web, the request-response language your browser uses to communicate with servers.</p>
          <p>When HTTP was first drafted in the early 1990s, its architects reserved a status code for future use that no one used: 402 Payment Required. It was meant for a future web where sites could natively charge small amounts for access, digital cash at the protocol layer. That web never arrived. Instead, we duct-taped credit cards, PayPal, and ad networks onto a system with no native money primitive. The foresight to reserve 402 was impressive; the follow-through just took three decades.</p>
          <p>That missing primitive, the lack of built-in payments, has been called the internet's original sin by people like Marc Andreessen.</p>
          <p>So when Cloudflare references x402 they are not just being cute; they are reviving that ghost. Use the long-dormant 402 idea as a protocol-level payment signal: a machine requests a resource, the server responds, "Sure, 402: pay the toll troll first." It is the internet finally cashing the check it wrote in the '90s.</p>

          <h2>Why Not Existing Rails?</h2>
          <p>If it is just "making a payment," agents could call Stripe or a bank API, right? Not really. Agents have different requirements than the rails humans typically transact on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>True autonomy.</strong> No humans in the loop: no logins, no cardholders, no approvals, no OTPs. The payment must be programmatic and self-authenticating.</li>
            <li><strong>Instant settlement.</strong> If an agent needs data in real time, it cannot wait for T+1 or T+2 settlement delays. NET Dollar is framed for real-time or near-instant transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Finality.</strong> No chargebacks, disputes, or post-transaction edits. Once a machine sends value, it is done.</li>
            <li><strong>Working micropayments.</strong> For tiny transactions, traditional fee stacks erode the upside. Remove human-centric fees and chargeback risk, and pay-per-use becomes viable.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How Machine-to-Machine Payments Work</h2>
          <p>A simplified loop looks like this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>An AI agent requests a resource (say, an API endpoint or a tiny dataset).</li>
            <li>The server returns a 402 Payment Required response with metadata that includes price, asset (NET Dollar), and destination.</li>
            <li>The agent signs a payment payload (a digital IOU from its wallet or facilitator) and retries with the signed proof attached.</li>
            <li>The server validates via a facilitator, such as Coinbase or a similar node, which abstracts wallets and chain plumbing.</li>
            <li>If valid, the server fulfills the request while the facilitator settles NET Dollar on the appropriate chain in the background.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>To the developer, it feels like normal HTTP, except that money is embedded within the protocol. The result is effectively stateless payment: no sessions, OAuth, or human login loops, just autonomous agents exchanging verified value.</p>
          <p><strong>Or, for simplicity:</strong> Agent A (payer) → Facilitator → NET Dollar → Settlement Layer → Facilitator → Merchant or Agent B (payee).</p>
          <p>Compare that with traditional financial rails: Customer → Merchant → Acquirer → Network → Issuer. The agentic version collapses a lot of legacy ceremony.</p>

          <h2>The Actors Involved</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>x402.</strong> Protocol-level signaling for payments in HTTP workflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Agents.</strong> Autonomous software acting on behalf of users or firms. Agent A is the payer, Agent B the payee.</li>
            <li><strong>Merchant or service.</strong> The API or data provider receiving funds.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment asset.</strong> NET Dollar, a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin.</li>
            <li><strong>Settlement layer.</strong> Likely a layer-2 blockchain.</li>
            <li><strong>Facilitator.</strong> An intermediary (maybe Coinbase, maybe PayAI) for custody, validation, and chain interaction so developers can just use APIs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Broader Context</h2>
          <p>If you squint, this is the sequel to last week's breakdown of card rails, acquirers, PSPs, and basis points. Those rails were built for humans swiping plastic. This rail is being constructed for machines exchanging packets of info at sub-second speeds, with cryptographic finality, and without dispute windows for all transaction sizes.</p>
          <h3>Open questions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Which chain or L2 will NET Dollar live on? Cloudflare calls it global and interoperable, but no public spec exists yet.</li>
            <li>Issuer, redeemer, and reserves: beyond "fully collateralized 1:1 USD," details are TBD.</li>
            <li>Regulation: how do regulators treat a stablecoin issued by an infrastructure company?</li>
            <li>Jurisdictions: stablecoins plus cross-border transactions equal a patchwork of laws and licensing.</li>
            <li>Fees and spreads: what do facilitators charge for tiny payments?</li>
            <li>Abuse: how do you rate-limit or reputation-score agents when they can be spun up infinitely?</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
          <p>That is it for today's machine-to-machine payments bonus. It is easy to dismiss this as "oh, just another stablecoin." If it succeeds, though, it could change how the internet generates revenue and how we interact with e-commerce.</p>
          <p>Intriguingly, this is an area where AI might be better without us. Payments with no human in the loop could simultaneously make our lives easier.</p>
          <p>Next time, it is back to our regularly scheduled programming: how banks actually store money and what real-time ledgers look like once you peel off the UI.</p>
          <p>Until then, thanks for reading. Bye.</p>
